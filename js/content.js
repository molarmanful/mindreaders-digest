    title: `A SHIFT IN MINDSET`,

WRITTEN BY: Matthew Spokes, CEO, Mindreader Technologies

I remember this game I used to play called Mindflex. The premise of this game was that you would control a fan that blew a light ball upwards or downwards; however, instead of using your hands to control this ball, you would use your mind. Mindflex came with an EEG headband which would read your brainwaves and send them to the fan. By varying your degree of concentration, you would be able to raise or lower the ball and pass through obstacle courses. Whether Mindflex was really a valid mental exercise as advertised is a discussion for another time; nevertheless, Mindflex was a commercial indication of a new interest in connecting mind and metal.

The 2000s and 2010s saw the sprouts of research in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). There was Neuralink, a startup founded by Elon Musk in 2016, which proposed the idea of a neural gateway between humans and artificial intelligence. There were brain-controlled prosthetic limbs which allowed the user to interact with the world as if they had never lost a limb in the first place. And then there were the commercial novelties like Mindflex, which packaged the idea of BCI into an affordable and accessible package for the curious child. Each of these three instances -- along with general improvements in our understanding of the human mind -- have helped paved the way for my company, Mindreader Technologies, to create revolutionary new ways of interacting with the world as we know it.

It has been twenty years since the founding of Mindreader Technologies, and ten years since the release of the first Mindreader interfaces. Time and time again, the Mindreaders have proven their invaluable worth to society. Gone are the days of lugging around laptops, tablets, and phones. Gone are the health detriments of staying indoors with eyes glued to the screen. Gone, gone indeed, are the days where we were slaves to technology, where we had to learn to adapt to the computer, where we lived in fear of a computer taking our jobs. Mindreader is our next step in human evolution; it gives us the opportunity to understand the computer and learn alongside it, not against it. More importantly, it makes connecting to other people, no matter how far, so much easier. Mindreader has made it possible for people around the world to communicate free from the inconveniences of language or disability; in fact, it is now possible for comatose patients to hold full conversations with their loved ones!

The mission of Mindreader Technologies has always been -- and will continue to be -- to develop, improve, and make accessible to the masses the Mindreader interfacing system. We believe that by doing so, humanity as a whole can prosper in a new world where our minds will know no limit to the things we can achieve.

The following is a transcript of the first-ever recorded conversation between a comatose patient and a conscious loved one. This feat was made possible with the assistance of Mindreaders implanted into both the patient and human, as well as months of acclimation training of the patient to the Mindreader.

[P is the patient, L is the son of P.]

L: Uh, hello?
[L fidgets nervously at the bedside of P.]

P: HELLO

[L is noticeably taken aback, but quickly regains composure.]
L: Dad? Is that you?

P: YES

[L noticeably tears up.]
L: Dad… it's been too long since I last spoke to you.

P: I MISSED YOU

L: I missed you too… I thought you were gone forever.

[P's message here is undecipherable. This is a likely occurrence when the brain is working excessively to form the message, especially since P's mind is greatly impaired at this time.]

L: I want you to know that I've been working hard to save money so we can move you to better care. Maybe someday, we can talk in person

P: GOOD
[At this point, P's condition deteriorates significantly, and the conversation is ended to prevent further harm to P.]

<u>NASA announces plans to switch to mind technology for astronaut communications</u>
WRITTEN BY: Alisa Firth, Correspondent, ███ News
---

NASA has announced ambitious plans to fit its next astronaut crew with brain implants. These implants are set to replace existing communications interfaces in spacesuits, which are notorious for being bulky and prone to interference. NASA expects that the brain implants will greatly reduce bulk caused by external communication equipment, giving system designers greater flexibility when working with other components of the suits. Additionally, the implants will hopefully eliminate miscommunication errors that the audio-based interfaces often suffer from.

These plans are indicative of a larger goal that NASA has to modernize their technology. A spokesperson for NASA put out this statement: "Over the years, NASA has lost its reputation as pioneers of space due to a variety of factors, most notably lack of funding and lack of interest. With the current administration's renewed interest in aerospace technology, however, we hope to revitalize that spirit of innovation and reclaim our role as leaders of space exploration. NASA looks forward to what the future holds, and hopes to inspire the next generation of spacefarers through our aspirations."

    title: `THE SILENT ROOM`,
    content: `\
WRITTEN BY: Thelma Morris

I used to have a nine-to-five office job. It wasn't high-paying by any means, but it was a stable job. I began working this job in my twenties, back when people still used computers. I got married and raised two fine children on the money I made from my job.

But then came the Mindreaders, and their adoption into the workplace. All of my coworkers had them installed; after all, who wouldn't? They're fast, easy to use, and -- most importantly -- simply better than the computer. But I never got a Mindreader; in fact, I couldn't. I had epilepsy, and epilepsy doesn't play well with electronics in the brain. At first, it wasn't much of a problem; I just stuck with my computer, reading my coworker's thought-produced messages with a screen.

But as time went on and my colleagues got better at using the Mindreader, I found it more and more difficult to keep up with the rapid speed of conversation at which people were "thinking." It was awkward being the only one in the room speaking, so I started typing more and more, but unfortunately my typing simply could not keep up with the speed of thought. Slowly but surely, I had become a burden, a liability to the company. I knew it, and my coworkers knew it too.

Innovation is a wild, relentless stampede that rushes towards promises of a better future while trampling the helpless sacrificial lambs. When industrial machinery and robots took over our factories, it was the manual laborers who were sacrificed. Now that the Mindreader is taking over our everyday lives, it is the people like me -- people who can't use the Mindreader for one reason or another -- who have become the lambs to the slaughter. Frankly, this little rant of mine is utterly pointless in the grand scheme of human progress, and yet here I am, flailing my arms, floundering helplessly like a sailor drowning at sea.

That fateful day came when my boss called me into his office. "Thelma," he said. "You have been a valued member of our company for almost twenty years now." But unfortunately, according to him, my inability to use the Mindreader had rendered me "insufficiently capable of continued productivity with respect to future company growth." He offered me the "respectable" option of an early retirement at 46 years old. "You know how it is. We need to make room, give opportunities to our younger recruits."

As I walked for the last time along the rows of cubicles stretching across the floor of the office, I looked out at the expanse -- not with my eyes, but with my ears. My ears saw nothing; no clickity-clack of the keyboard, no buzzing of the printer, no squeaking of chairs, not even the low hum of air-conditioning. The room was silent; the minds were not.

But what good is my mind if it only perceives the silent room?

    title: `PSA: OFF-BRAND IMPLANTS`,
    content: `\
The following is a public service announcement from the United States Food and Drug Administration:

Several cases of brain-computer implant combustion have recently been reported, all of which involve unauthorized -- "off-brand" -- implants. The U.S. FDA does not condone the purchase and installation of these off-brand implants. Doing so is not only illegal ("freebooting"), but is also extremely dangerous. Off-brand implants are not bound to the same safety and quality control standards of their FDA-approved counterparts; in addition, off-brand implants are more susceptible to malfunctions. The FDA strongly recommends consumers to instead buy implants only from FDA-approved brands, and undergo proper screening and installation procedures at reputable local clinics.

<u>BREAKING NEWS: NSA leak reveals that the government can read our thoughts</u>
WRITTEN BY: Xavier Dominguez, Correspondent, ████ News
---

In an astonishing repetition of history, a new NSA leak has revealed that the government has been gathering usage and analytics data from implants installed in consumers. This was done through exploitation of firmware vulnerabilities present in many of the leading implant brands. 

According to a statement released by the NSA shortly after the leaks, the data was ostensibly used "for counterterrorism and homeland security purposes." However, documents from the leak suggest that these vulnerabilities have also been found, and perhaps even used, by third-party entities. According to cybersecurity analyst Douglas Meadows, it is entirely possible that "groups of malicious intent can gain unauthorized access to the same user data that the NSA has access to, as well as the means to alter the behavior of implants at will."

Many of the leading implant developers have already begun shipping firmware updates to patch vulnerabilities. It is unclear whether any further action will be taken by these developers to prevent future security breaches.

ARCHIVIST NOTE:

The advertisement was targeted at married women whose thought analytics presented predisposition to paranoia and anxiety, especially with regards to relationship security. Following the advertisement led to a site which offered "secret thought-probing services performed by certified private investigators." In actuality, the site was a conduit for data and identity theft. It is estimated that a total of over 700,000 Mindreader users had given their data to these fake service sites.
