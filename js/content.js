WRITTEN BY: Matthew Spokes, CEO of Mindreader Technologies

I remember this game I used to play called Mindflex. The premise of this game was that you would control a fan that blew a light ball upwards or downwards; however, instead of using your hands to control this ball, you would use your mind. Mindflex came with an EEG headband which would read your brainwaves and send them to the fan. By varying your degree of concentration, you would be able to raise or lower the ball and pass through obstacle courses. Whether Mindflex was really a valid mental exercise as advertised is a discussion for another time; nevertheless, Mindflex was a commercial indication of a new interest in connecting mind and metal.

The 2000s and 2010s saw the revitalization of research in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). There was Neuralink, a startup founded by Elon Musk in 2016, which proposed the idea of a neural gateway between humans and artificial intelligence. There were brain-controlled prosthetic limbs which allowed the user to interact with the world as if they had never lost a limb in the first place. And then there were the commercial novelties like Mindflex, which packaged the idea of BCI into an affordable and accessible package for the curious child. Each of these three instances -- along with general improvements in our understanding of the human mind -- have helped paved the way for my company, Mindreader Technologies, to create revolutionary new ways of interacting with the world as we know it.

It has been twenty years since the founding of Mindreader Technologies, and ten years since the release of the first Mindreader interfaces. Time and time again, the Mindreaders have proven their invaluable worth to society. Gone are the days of lugging around laptops, tablets, and phones. Gone are the health detriments of staying indoors with eyes glued to the screen. Gone, gone indeed, are the days where we were slaves to technology, where we had to learn to adapt to the computer, where we lived in fear of a computer taking our jobs. Mindreader is our next step in human evolution; it gives us the opportunity to understand the computer and learn alongside it, not against it. More importantly, it makes connecting to other people, no matter how far, so much easier. Mindreader has made it possible for people around the world to communicate free from the inconveniences of language or disability; in fact, it is now possible for comatose patients to hold full conversations with their loved ones!

The mission of Mindreader Technologies has always been -- and will continue to be -- to develop, improve, and make accessible to the masses the Mindreader interfacing system. We believe that by doing so, humanity as a whole can prosper in a new world where our minds will know no limit to the things we can achieve.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Ensure that your Mindreader is powered on. In your mind's eye, picture anything with your imagination. Now, with that image still in your mind, focus on the white above and project your image onto the white. Pay attention to making the image clear and accurate.
